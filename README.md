# An implementation of some classical machine learning algorithms

This is Python library implemented some Machine Learning algorithms using `numpy` from scratch, which was done in Machine Learning Course at HCMUT. 

## List of algorithms:
 - Linear Regression 
 - Logistic Regression 
 - Softmax Regression 
 - Support Vector Machine (SVM) 
 - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
 - Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) 
 - ID3 Decision Tree
 - Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
